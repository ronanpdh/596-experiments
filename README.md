# 596-experiments

A collection of UI experiments. 

You can view and interact with the components here [experiments](https://www.596.studio/)


Most of these UI experiments use the following:

[**Tailwind**](https://tailwindui.com/)

[**Framer Motion**](https://www.framer.com/motion/)

[**Font Awesome**](https://fontawesome.com/)

---

You will need to have these installed and configured to use the UI components. 

If you do use these please let me know what you think or if anything can be improved. 

Down the line I may make these into an package for easy download and install.
